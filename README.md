## General Information

TaurusTLS provides 3.x support for Indy - Internet Direct.  It includes headers plus two components for Delphi and C++Builder.  Those components are:

- TTaurusTLSIOHandlerSocket - Enables TLS in a TIdTCPClientCustom descendant.
- TTaurusTLSServerIOHandler - Enables TLS in a TIdCustomTCPServer descendant.

Both components are in the TaurusTLS.pas unit and the components are available on the IDE palette page, “TaurusTLS”.

TaurusTLS supports the following operating systems:

- Android
- iOS
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows

## License

TaurusTLS is dual licensed. You can review which license better suits your needs, and use that license.  You can even change your mind later if you have previously chosen one.

The TaurusTLS Modified BSD license is a very no nonsense license that allows you to do almost anything you want with TaurusTLS provided you provide proper attribution.  Details are available in the Modified_BSD_LICENSE.md file included in the with this source-code.

To make it easier and consistent for JEDI users, we also offer an MPL license v1.1.  Details are available in the LICENSE_MPL_1_1.txt file included with this source-code.

## RAD Studio Installation

TaurusTLS supports the following RAD Studio versions:

- Florence (Delphi 13) - packages in the TaurusTLS\Packages\d13 folder
- Athens (Delphi 12) - packages in the TaurusTLS\Packages\d12 folder
- Alexandria (Delphi 11) - package in the TaurusTLS\Packages\d11 folder
- Sydney (Delphi 10.4) - package in the TaurusTLS\Packages\dsydney folder
- Rio (Delphi 10.3) - package in the TaurusTLS\Packages\drio folder
- Tokyo (Delphi 10.2) - package in the TaurusTLS\Packages\dtokyo folder
- Berlin (Delphi 10.1) - package in the TaurusTLS\Packages\dberlin folder
- Seattle (Delphi 10) - package in the TaurusTLS\Packages\dseattle folder

You may make packages for older versions of RAD Studio.

### For Indy Included with Delphi

1. Open TaurusAll.groupproj in the TaurusTLS\Packages\d12 folder.
2. Compile TaurusTLS_RT.
3. Compile TaurusTLS_DT and install it in the IDE.

You may install TaurusTLS into the 64-bit Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using the same procedure.

If you have [TMS Smart Setup 2.0](https://doc.tmssoftware.com/smartsetup/) with **no credentials** required, go to the "TMS Smart Setup Console", and do the following to install TaurusTLS:

```
tms configure
tms install taurustls_developers.taurustls
```

### For Indy that was Upgraded from the Website

1. Set the INDY_PATH environment variable for your user account to the location where Indy is located.
2. Open TaurusForIndy290All.groupproj in the TaurusTLS\Packages\d12 folder.
3. Compile TaurusTLS_RTForIndy290.
4. Compile TaurusTLS_DTForIndy290 and install it in the IDE.

You may install TaurusTLS into the 64-bit Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using the same procedure.

### Making your own Packages

I suggest that you have 2 separate packages; a runtime only package and a design-time package.  

The run-time package should depend upon your Indy package files and include the following:

- Source\TaurusTLS.pas
- Source\TaurusTLS_Files.pas
- Source\TaurusTLS_NTLM.pas
- Source\TaurusTLS_ResourceStrings.pas
- Source\TaurusTLS_Utils.pas
- Source\TaurusTLS_X509.pas
- Source\TaurusTLSConsts.pas
- Source\TaurusTLSExceptionHandlers.pas
- Source\TaurusTLSFIPS.pas
- Source\TaurusTLSHeaders_*.pas
- Source\TaurusTLSLoader.pas

The design-time package should depend upon the run-time package and include the following files:

- Source\TaurusTLS_Dsn_AboutDlg.pas
- Source\TaurusTLS_Dsn_ComponentEditor.pas
- Source\TaurusTLS_Dsn_Register.pas
- Source\TaurusTLS_Dsn_ResourceStrings.pas

## Lazarus Installation

1. Open taurustlsldsgn.lpk from the TaurusTLS/Packages/lazarus.
2. From "Required Packages", open "TaurusTLSRT" and compile it.
3. Then compile the main package itself and install it in the IDE.

## Deploying Your Applications

TaurusTLS requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or OpenSSL 3.x.

### Static Libraries (OpenSSL 3.x ONLY)

Static libraries (`.a` files) can be used with Android, iOS and macOS. Precompiled versions of the libraries are available at: <https://github.com/TaurusTLS-Developers/OpenSSL-Distribution/tree/main/binaries> and <https://github.com/TurboPack/OpenSSL-Distribution/tree/main/binaries>. There are also instructions for building the libraries at: <https://github.com/TurboPack/OpenSSL-Distribution/tree/main/build-scripts>.

### Linux

On Linux, OpenSSL is usually installed by default.  We recommend that developers document this requirement in case users need to install updated versions of OpenSSL.

### Windows

On Windows, OpenSSL is not installed by default so you have to redistribute it along with your software by placing the library files in the same directory as your executable.   You can choose to either deploy OpenSSL 1.1.1 (not recommended) or an OpenSSL 3.x version.  As of this writing, the current OpenSSL 3.x versions are 3.0.17, 3.2.5, 3.3.4, 3.4.2, and 3.5.1.  Pre-compiled .DLL’s for these versions are available at <https://github.com/TaurusTLS-Developers/OpenSSL-Distribution/tree/main/binaries/Windows> and <https://github.com/TurboPack/OpenSSL-Distribution/tree/main/binaries/Windows>.  

For Win32 applications, you need to redistribute the following:

OpenSSL 1.1.1  (not recommended because OpenSSL 1.1.1 has reached its end of life)

- libcrypto-1_1.dll
- libssl-1_1.dll

OpenSSL 3.x

- libcrypto-3.dll
- libssl-3.dll

For Win64 applications, you need to redistribute the following:

OpenSSL 1.1.1  (not recommended because OpenSSL 1.1.1 has reached its end of life)

- libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll
- libssl-1_1-x64.dll

OpenSSL 3.x

- libcrypto-3-x64.dll
- libssl-3-x64.dll

We strongly urge you to redistribute the openssl.exe included with the .DLL's along with your program.  Some of your users may need it to:

1. Generate keys
2. Create Certificate Signing Requests
3. Create self-signed Certificates
4. Examine certificates
6. convert Certificate

There's a reference book called the *OpenSSL Cookbook* at <https://www.feistyduck.com/books/openssl-cookbook/>.

## Component Reference

TaurusTLS includes a component reference in "Compiled HTML Help file (.chm)" format in the Help\chm directory.

## Demo Programs

Taurus TLS includes 3 demo programs.  

### TaurusTLS\src\demos\FTPServer\TaurusFTPServer.dproj  

This is a FTP Server with TLS enabled that runs in the Windows console.  This program has been tested with the following FTP clients:

- FileZilla - <https://filezilla-project.org/>
- SmartFTP - <https://www.smartftp.com/en-us/>
- WinSCP - <https://winscp.net/eng/index.php>
- WS_FTP Professional - <https://www.progress.com/resources/papers/ws-ftp-pro-data-sheet>

This program requires a certificate to run.  Instructions for creating a self-signed certificate are available at [https://technotes.shemyak.com/posts/min-openssl-cnf/](https://technotes.shemyak.com/posts/min-openssl-cnf/).  You then need to create a server.ini file in the executable directory that enables the certificate that has the following lines:

```text
[Certificate]
CertificateFile=[path to your public certificate file]
KeyFile=[path to your private SSL key]
Password=[password for your private SSL key]
```

You can also do the following:

1. Copy the OpenSSL .dll's and openssl.exe to the directory where the FTP server demo .exe is built.  Usually that is \\$\(platform\)\\Debug or \\$\(platform\)\\Release.
2. Run the makecert.bat to generate a self-signed certificate.  Just answer the prompts and the certificate is generated.
3. Run the FTP Server .exe and it will create a default server.ini file that points to the certificate files generated in Step 2.

### TaurusTLS\demos\TaurusFTPConsole\taurusftp.dpr and taurusftp.lpr

This is a fully functional cross-platform console FTP client that can be built with both Delphi and Lazaurus.  It has been tested with the following servers:

- FileZilla Server - <https://filezilla-project.org/>
- ProFTPD - <http://www.proftpd.org/>
- PureFTPD - <https://www.pureftpd.org/>
- vsftpd - <https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html>
- Xlight FTP Server - <https://www.xlightftpd.com/>

For help using the client, just use the "help" command.

### TaurusTLS\Demos\TaurusHTTPServer\taurusHTTPServer.dpr and taurusHTTPServer.lpr

This is a minimal HTTP Server that only replies with a 200 code and an empty page.  This program is used for testing the server component for cross-platform usage.  This program requires a certificate file (domain.crt) and a private key file (domain.key) that has to generated by the openssl.exe program.
